          <p>My name is M. Ikhsan Aflahal,and I was born in Bandar Lampung on December 27, 2004. I began my education at Madrasah Ibtidaiyah Negeri 9 Bandar Lampung, where I learned the fundamentals of both religious and general education, which laid the foundation for my knowledge. After completing my elementary education, I continued my studies at Qur'an Daarul Fattah Junior High School, where I received an education focused on religious curriculum and character development.</p>
          <p>Subsequently, I attended Qur'an Daarul Fattah Senior High School, where I deepened my religious studies and participated in various extracurricular activities that enhanced my leadership and teamwork skills. Currently, I am pursuing my higher education at Sekolah Tinggi Terpadu Nurul Fikri, where I am in my first semester and striving to expand my knowledge and skills in my field of interest.In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a variety of hobbies and interests that I actively engage in. I enjoy swimming, fishing, playing futsal, volleyball, and badminton, as well as jogging. My favorite fruit is durian, and I particularly love Padang rice as my favorite dish. For beverages, I have a fondness for avocado juice.With a solid educational background and a strong passion for learning, I hope to contribute positively to both academic and professional environments in the future.</p>
